# Thesis DTP Talk

Practice based PhDs

Traditionally made up of exhibition and write up.

HOW AND WHY?




i didn't do quantitative data analysis (e.g. questionnaires)
but i did do lots of critical self-evaluation.
each decision was analysed retrospectively in minute detail (numbers, numbers, numbers)

meronym anectode (during analysis I found that i should have included meronyms and added that into the artefact then)

critical analysis of theoretical / philosophical aspects




How did I present my practical element? In my case the website and the search results. So I scattered poems from the engine throughout the thesis. 

Chapter on code. 

I didn’t go overboard with documenting the actual website, e.g. few screenshots, video results barely discussed.
